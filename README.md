## Overview

This is a wrapper around [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) that is easy to integrate as a [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) subproject.

It stuffs blobs of binary data, identified by a unique integer, in a single DB table: messy, like a boydem.

## Legal Information

The ASCII art logo at the top was made using [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/).
